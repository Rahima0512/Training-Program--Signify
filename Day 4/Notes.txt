1.Abstract class
2.Final Modifier
3.Interface implementation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.Abstract class: It is a complete class which contains the implemented/non implemented methods
	1.1 We can extend the abstract class @ single level
	1.2 We can't create an object of abstract class !

In Java we can achieve various kind of inheritence at different levels:
	1.1 Single level
	1.2 Multi level
	1.3 Hierarchical
	1.4 Multiple 
Assignment Create various dummy class with Name A,B,C,D with some methods & achieve the various kind of inheritence
	1.Single
	2.multiple
	3.multilevel
	4.Hybrid
	5.Hierarchical
Final is a very important keyword in java to restrict inheritence.

1.In are using for the declaration of the services which has to implement in various ways
2.We can create an interface with the help of interface keyword in java.
3. We cann create the instance of the interface but we can't instantiate it.
4.In most of the java project development we use interface because it will give us flexible implementation.

Task 3:

Create the relevant interface based on the CRS services in the project and implement those services in operational classes
Example:AdminInterface ->Implement->inside the AdminServiceOperation

NOTE: In the client menu create the instance of the interface in all places.

Final push in the git

COllection and Generics

collection is evolved form of array. It has optimized algo
it is a object which contains multiple object at a time
Now we are useing collection witrh generics to make typesafe the collection object and is represented by <>
We will focus java 1.8 or 1.11 for further project implementstion and data manipulation. The commonly used collection for data manipulations are
list set and map whuch will implement in various ways are various classes.

All collection interfaces is a part of java.util package.

--> List is an interface which can be implemented anf a linked list,vector
    7.1 List contain the duplicate element inside the collection
        It contains data in the sequential manner
    Set is a different kind of collection that is implemented with hash set, sorted set
    It randomly allocates memory for data
---> Map is a superior collection which is implemented using various classes:hash table, tree map
    It contains the collection in form of key and pair

    Key will always but data can be duplicate.


Hashset contain the data in random order
Tree set contain the data in sorting order(Asc to dsc).

Task 4:
Start to implement all respective methods in CRS application of all the services
For ex-> StudentServiceOperations,AdminServiceOperation etc using the collection with hard coded
