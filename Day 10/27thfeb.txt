10>Spring Framework build on some design patterns like factory abstract factory,DI(Important)[Dependency Injection]

(Rambagh,Goog)-OOPs books very good.

OODesign.com

11>***********Solution of reoccuring problem is called design pattern***********
12>Combination of libraries using some design patterns creates a framework. eg. Spring,Apache.

13>In Spring Development we use two kind of configuration design:
	1.XML Configuration
	2.Annotation(Predefined rules by Spring)
14> Annotation used in development:
	- @SpringBootApplication: used to up the spring application
	- @Configuration: this annotatio use to configure the module configuration in spring project
	- @EnableAutoConfiguration: this annotation enable the depended module in psring app by default
	- @Bean: In it represents the java java class in spring as bean component
	- @ComponentScan: it scans all the component in spring project to the specific package
	- StereoType Annotation:
		1. Spring component: @Component
		2. Spring Service: @Service
		3. Spring DAO: @Repository
		4. Spring RestController: @RestController
		5. Spring Controller: @Controller
	-@Autowire: it is used to inject dependency

-> REST in an architectural style (Representational State Transfer) which helps us to develop the respective application as web services
-> Spring REST has written on top of the JSRX API which developed by the sun microsoft or oracle
-> Using spring REST we can transform the java objec in four important MIME (Multipurpuse Internal Mail Extensions) ex: json, xml, txt
-> Spring REST helping us to develop the nature of web application which is based on client-server architecture
-> When we are going to develop REST application we use REST Controller which is annotated by REST Controller Annotation
-> In our earlier application transformation, the following architectural flow
	Client (REST Controller) -> Service ->    DAO -> Database 
	@REST Controller         -> @Service -> (Repository) -> Database
	
This is demo:	
	DEMO 1: Hello world application using Spring REST
	Demo 2-Curd application of mgmt
For CURD operation :
	1.Create ->@PostMapping
	2.Update -> @PutMapping
	3.Delete ->@DeleteMapping
	4.Fetch-> @GetMapping
	
Request Mapping:All those annotation are squezed and concised  in one annotation represent by the @RequestMapping

For Managing the REST operation we use 2 important client:
	1.POSTMAN
	2.Advance REST Client

Create and Copied all respective packages  from pos application in the newly created Project  CRS-Signify-SpringRest-Group-D
Add create a new package com.signify.restcontroller
Note:Create all the controller
	AdminRestController
	StudentRestController
