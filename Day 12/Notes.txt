WHY TypeScript?
1.TypeScript is a modern compiler and modern javascript language which is wrappering up on top of the javascript tools 
2.TypeScript itself is javascript with modern rules and regulation
3.We need to install the typescript using npm extension in the node in the following command:
	1.npm install -g typescript
	2.tsc --version
4.TypeScript is providing us the next level of modern development based on add on concept in javascript:
	1.New level of modifiers:like public private protected read only
	2.Enum
	3.Varieties of function with default and optional parameter:Interface generics etc.
5.We can create TypeScript file with .ts extension

HOW TS COMPILER WORKS:
	source file(.ts)-------> compile with tsc --------> convert to ES5 javascript 
	
TASK 12:
	Convert the above assignment in TypeScript with all the rules followed by earlier example

ANGULAR:
1.Angular13 is UI/UX framework based on MVC pattern
MVC [Model-setter getter]
V stands for template in angular 
C stands for controller

2.In project creating of angular we generally use Angular CLI which is managing the complete life cycle of angular project -build/deploy/test etc
3.For installation of angular CLI we use the following command:
	1.npm install -g @angular/cli -takes latest version
	2.npm install -g @angular/cli@13.2.0
	3. ng --version
4.angular cli & NPM are similar to maven which are maintaining the complete angular lifecycle project .
