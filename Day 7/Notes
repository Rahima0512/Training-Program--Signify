	5.Throws
	
3> The super class in exception hierarchy in java container is Throwable.This throwable class which is a very important class in exception hirerachy this class decides the 
type of object in unexpected condition of the execution of the program whether it is a error or an exception.

NOTE: In Enterprise projects we can handle the exception in two ways.
	1.Using java container->Handled by jvm
	2.Java container with custom exception framework with custom messages.->Handled by custom message by developer.
